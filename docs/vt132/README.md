## Overview

I first tweeted about the VT132 in [March 2019](https://twitter.com/TheHighNibble/status/1110861587751927811)
I had put together a first prototype in time for mVCF - Melbourne (AUS)

![V1.0](./VT132_v1.0.jpeg)

Back then it was simply the hardware implementation of the brilliant work done by Fabrizio Di Vittorio in creating the [FabGL library](http://www.fabglib.org/) for the ESP32. An ANSI/VT compatible, serially connected terminal with VGA output and a PS/2 keyboard.

But I wanted to extend his work and make a very authentic implementation of the DEC VT100 down to every reasonable detail.

Clearly from the prototype I'd already chosen the initial form-factor to be a "Designed for RC2014" expansion card for the RC2014 bus.

I then took a break from the VT132 while I worked to finish another little project - the [IMSAI 8080 replica](/imsai8080/)

In [January 2020](https://twitter.com/TheHighNibble/status/1215533158717775872) I again tweeted about the VT132 because I'd started to play around with it once more.

I'd added most of the authentic VT100 features I could think of, and decided that since the ESP32 has lots of UARTS and WiFi, that I would include a Telnet over WiFi, 'AT' (Hayes) style modem on a second UART. I'd already developed the modem code for the IMSAI8080 replica, so it was easy to integrate it into the VT132.

This is where the fun/trouble began...

- FabGL is an Arduino library. Running FabGL @ 800x600 native resolution (800x300 scanline doubled) consumes a lot of the ESP32s internal memory.
- Turning on WiFi in the Arduino environment on an ESP32 also consumes a lot of the ESP32s internal memory.
- Moving to the ESP32-WROVER with 8Mb of SPRAM helps a little, but it's still the internal memory that is the limiting resource.
- The Arduino IDE for ESP32 doesn't let you control and fine-tune all the memory and network resource allocation like the ESP-IDF does.
- But Espressif thought of that...
  - It is possible to run the Arduino library as a component in the ESP-IDF environment.
  - I was easily able to make FabGL behave as an ESP-IDF component too.

By April 2020 I was able to start posting [videos to YouTube showcasing the features of the VT132](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLADkYVZqAxdO1fTDprnp_jRCTQ-9n1OIV).

![V1.2](./VT132_v1.2.png)

In June & July 2020 I conducted a closed Beta program with some fantastic people from the Retro-computer community. Their contribution to improving the VT132 and accelerating the development, ready for production has been invaluable.

#### (White PCB)

In July 2020 the **VT132 Designed for RC2014** edition began shipping to the patiently waiting early-adopters.

### VT132 Stand Alone edition

#### (Black PCB)

Since its first release there has been regular feedback that a stand alone version of the VT132 would be warranted, to work with systems other than the RC2014.

In October 2020 the **VT132 Stand Alone** edition was released.

:::tip Note:
The two editions are functionally equivalent when it comes to the features of the **VT100** terminal and the **Telnet/WiFi 'AT' (Hayes) Modem**

Where they differ is in respect to:

- powering the the VT132
- serial communications connectivity
- physical format and dimensions

See each section below for details.
